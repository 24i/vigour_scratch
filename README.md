Scratch Framework
=============

**LESS boilerplate and styleguide for front end projects.**

Scratch helps you to make abstract CSS architecture using `Less`.

It has semantic code and file structure which helps you write beautiful and modular code.

Scratch is not UI framework, it's for architecture only. For DOM, styles and UI elements you can look at those repositories: [vigour-io/element](https://github.com/vigour-io/element) and [vigour-io/uikit](https://github.com/vigour-io/uikit).

-------------

Getting Started
-------------

To install, run:

	$ npm install vigour-scratch

Injecting in Browserify:

	require('vigour-scratch');

Injecting in less:

	@import 'vigour-scratch/index.less';

-------------

More documentation will be soon.
