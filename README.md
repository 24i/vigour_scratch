Scratch helps you to make high level front end architecture using `Less` and `HTML5`.

It has semantic code and file structure which helps you write beautiful code.

Scratch is not UI framework, it's for architecture only. If you wish, you just can reference other UI framework and continue working. See how to reference section below.
