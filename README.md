Scratch Framework
=============
**Currently under the heavy process of refactoring.**

**LESS boilerplate and styleguide for front end projects.**

Scratch helps you to make high level front end architecture using `Less` and `HTML5`.

It has semantic code and file structure which helps you write beautiful and modular code.

Scratch is not UI framework, it's for architecture only. For DOM, styles and UI elements you can look at those: [vigour-io/element](https://github.com/vigour-io/element) and [vigour-io/uikit](https://github.com/vigour-io/uikit)

-------------

Getting Started
-------------

To install run:

	$ npm install vigour-scratch

Using in Browserify:

More documentation will be soon.
